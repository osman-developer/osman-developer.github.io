Hello, this is the angular project of Corona tracking. In this project I used https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries/+countryName API in which I retreived the corona cases from all the countries around the world. 
In this application I did two components and I made a service in order for them to communicate together. I updated this application several times in terms of designs and fixed the naming of some countries.
